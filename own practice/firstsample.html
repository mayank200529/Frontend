            <h1 class="heading">What is a computer?</h1>
            <p>A <b>computer</b> is an <b>electronic device that manipulates information, data</b>. It has the ability to store, retrieve, and process data. You may already know that you can use a <b>computer</b> to type documents, send email, play games, and browse the Web. You can also use it to edit or create spreadsheets, presentations, and even videos.</p>

            <h1 class="heading">Hardware vs. software</h1>
            <p>Before we talk about different types of <b>computer</b>, let's talk about two things all <b>computer</b> have in common: hardware and software. <br>Hardware is any part of your computer that has a physical structure, such as the keyboard or mouse. It also includes all of the computer's internal parts, which you can see in the image below.</p>
            <div class="imgdiv">

            </div>
            <p>Software is any set of instructions that tells the hardware what to do and how to do it. Examples of software include web browsers, games, and word processors.</p>

            </div>
            <p>Everything you do on your computer will rely on both hardware and software. For example, right now you may be viewing this lesson in a web browser (software) and using your mouse (hardware) to click from page to page. As you learn about different types of <b>computer</b>, ask yourself about the differences in their hardware. As you progress through this tutorial, you'll see that different types of computers also often use different types of software.</p>

            <h1 class="heading">What are the different types of computers?</h1>
            <p>When most people hear the word computer, they think of a personal<b>computer</b> such as a desktop or laptop. However,<b>computer</b>s come in many shapes and sizes, and they perform many different functions in our daily lives. When you withdraw cash from an ATM, scan groceries at the store, or use a calculator, you're using a type of<b>computer</b>.</p>

            <h1 class="heading">DESKTOP COMPUTERS</h1>
            <div class="imgdiv">
                <img src="https://media.gcflearnfree.org/content/55e0730c7dd48174331f5164_01_17_2014/whatisacomputer_desktop_computers.jpg" class="img" alt="">
            </div>
            <p>Many people use desktop computers at work, home, and school. Desktop computers are designed to be placed on a desk, and they're typically made up of a few different parts, including the computer case, monitor, keyboard, and mouse.</p>
            <h1 class="heading">Laptop Computers</h1>
            <div class="imgdiv">
                <img src="https://media.gcflearnfree.org/content/55e0730c7dd48174331f5164_01_17_2014/whatisacomputer_laptop_computers.jpg" class="img" alt="">
            </div>
            <p>The second type of computer you may be familiar with is a laptop computer, commonly called a laptop. Laptops are battery-powered computers that are more portable than desktops, allowing you to use them almost anywhere.</p>
            <h1 class="heading">Tablet Computers</h1>
            <div class="imgdiv">
                <img src="https://media.gcflearnfree.org/content/55e0730c7dd48174331f5164_01_17_2014/whatisacomputer_tablet_computers.jpg" class="img" alt="">
            </div>
            <p>Tablet computers—or tablets—are handheld computers that are even more portable than laptops. Instead of a keyboard and mouse, tablets use a touch-sensitive screen for typing and navigation. The iPad is an example of a tablet.</p>
            <h1 class="heading">Servers</h1>
            <div class="imgdiv">
                <img src="https://media.gcflearnfree.org/content/55e0730c7dd48174331f5164_01_17_2014/whatisacomputer_servers.jpg" class="img" alt="">
            </div>  
            <p>A server is a computer that serves up information to other computers on a network. For example, whenever you use the Internet, you're looking at something that's stored on a server. Many businesses also use local file servers to store and share files internally.
