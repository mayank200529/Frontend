                <p>A computer is a device that helps us complete tasks quickly and efficiently. Unlike humans, computers don't think on their own and need specific instructions to operate. These instructions are given in binary language, which only contains two values: 0 (off) and 1 (on). Computers use tiny devices called transistors to store and process these values. For example, memory chips in a computer consist of billions of transistors, which enable it to store and manipulate data through combinations of 0s and 1s. This structure allows computers to execute complex tasks by following binary-encoded instructions.A computer is a device that helps us complete tasks quickly and efficiently.
